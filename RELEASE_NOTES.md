# Release v1.4.1

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### "Proxy to Client" Ack Restoration (The "Red X" Fix)
- **Implicit ACK Echoes**: Fixed a critical bug where `mqtt-proxy`'s strict loop protection dropped echoed messages from the MQTT Broker.
  - When the Meshtastic firmware has `proxy_to_client_enabled: true` set, it stops generating automatic "Implicit ACKs" for transmissions.
  - Instead, the firmware expects the MQTT broker to echo the message back so it knows it was successfully delivered.
  - By bypassing the deduplicator specifically for echoed messages (where `gateway_id` matches the local node ID), the firmware now receives the delivery confirmation it needs.
  - This prevents `MAX_RETRANSMIT` timeouts and fixes the "Red X" (Failed delivery status) issue in MeshMonitor for both DMs and Channel Broadcasts.

## 📝 Documentation
- **CONFIG.md**: Added warnings and explanations around the `proxy_to_client_enabled` setting and how it alters firmware timeout behavior.
- **README.md**: Added "Implicit ACK Restoration" to the core features list and clarified the Architecture section's "How It Works".

# Release v1.3.0

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Missed Messages (False Positive ACKs)
- **Ignored Implicit ACKs from Self/Local**: Fixed an issue where local routing confirmation packets were incorrectly interpreted as successful delivery acknowledgments from remote nodes.
  - The proxy now explicitly checks the `sender` of `ROUTING_APP` packets.
  - Packets where `sender == 0` (local routing confirmation) are ignored.
  - Packets where `sender == myNodeNum` (echoes from self) are ignored.
  - This ensures `meshtastic.ack` events are only emitted for high-confidence confirmations, improving message reliability logic.

## 🧪 Test Coverage
- Added new unit tests in `tests/test_meshtastic_extended.py` to verify implicit ACK suppression for self and sender 0.

# Release v1.2.0

## 🛡️ Reliability & Stability Improvements

### Thread-Safe Radio Interactions
- **Locked Radio Access**: Implemented thread-safe `_sendToRadio` using the interface's internal locking mechanism.
  - Prevents potential race conditions when multiple handlers attempt to send data to the radio simultaneously.
  - Added fallback with warning if `_sendToRadio` is missing (e.g., in older `meshtastic` library versions).

### Enhanced Packet Management
- **Improved Deduplication**: Refined the deduplication logic to better handle packet IDs and sender tracking.
  - Prevents message loops when proxying traffic between MQTT and the mesh network.

### Robust Health Monitoring
- **Configuration Race Condition Fix**: Addressed a race condition in MQTT handler initialization to ensure reliable startup and state management.
- **Improved Health Checks**: Enhanced watchdog mechanisms for better reporting of proxy status.

## 📊 Performance & Monitoring

### Latency Logging
- **Detailed Message Queue Stats**: Added precise timing logs for message processing.
  - New Log Format: `Message processed. Queue: N msgs, Wait: X.XXXs, Send: X.XXXs`
  - Helps track transit times and identify bottlenecks in radio transmissions.

## 🧪 Test Coverage & CI/CD

### Enhanced Test Suite
- **Queue Handler Coverage**: Increased test coverage for `handlers/queue.py` to ensure reliable buffering and rate limiting.
- **Thread Safety Validation**: Added tests to verify thread-safe usage of the radio interface.

### CI/CD Optimizations
- **Build Trigger Cleanup**: Fixed duplicate Docker image builds by refining push event wildcard triggers.
- **Cleanup Workflow Fix**: Resolved `Invalid Cut-off` errors in image retention policy by updating to properly formatted duration strings (`14d`).

## 🔄 Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible.

## 📊 Testing Status
All tests passing with improved coverage in core message handling modules.

# Release v1.1.2

## 🚀 Performance & Reliability Improvements

### Major Performance Enhancement
- **50x faster MQTT-to-node forwarding**: Reduced default `MESH_TRANSMIT_DELAY` from 500ms to 10ms
  - Typical transmission is ~1ms, 10ms provides safe spacing while maintaining responsiveness
  - Configurable via `MESH_TRANSMIT_DELAY` environment variable
  
### Retained Message Filtering  
- **Prevents startup floods**: Skip retained MQTT messages by default
  - Eliminates 4+ second queue backlogs when connecting to broker
  - Retained messages are historical state, not live mesh traffic
  - Opt-in via `MQTT_FORWARD_RETAINED=true` if needed

### Enhanced Monitoring
- **Queue depth logging**: Added current queue size to message processing logs
  - Format: `Queue: N msgs, Wait: X.XXXs, Send: X.XXXs`
  - Helps identify backlogs and performance issues

## 🧪 Test Coverage Improvements

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **40 tests → 42 tests**: Added extensive coverage for critical paths
- **87% total coverage** across all handlers
  - `handlers/mqtt.py`: 90% coverage
  - `handlers/meshtastic.py`: 77% coverage  
  - `handlers/node_tracker.py`: 86% coverage
  - `handlers/queue.py`: 92% coverage

### New Test Files
- `test_mqtt_extended.py`: TLS configuration, error handling, edge cases
- `test_meshtastic_extended.py`: Byte parsing, implicit ACKs, DecodeError handling
- `test_proxy_health.py`: Health checks, watchdog mechanisms, state management
- `test_retained_messages.py`: Retained message filtering validation

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Critical**: Fixed `fromId` AttributeError in packet tracking
  - MeshPacket protobuf only has `from` field, not `fromId`
  - Was causing "Failed to track node/packet: fromId" errors
  
- **CI/CD**: Fixed module import errors in GitHub Actions
  - Added `sys.path.append()` to test files for proper module resolution

- **Pytest**: Renamed `TestInterface` to `MixinTestHelper`
  - Eliminates pytest warning about test classes with `__init__` constructors

## 📝 Configuration

### New Environment Variables
- `MESH_TRANSMIT_DELAY`: Delay between messages (default: `0.01` seconds)
- `MQTT_FORWARD_RETAINED`: Forward retained messages (default: `false`)

## 🔄 Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible

## 📊 Testing
All 42 tests passing with 87% coverage across handlers
