# MQTT Proxy Debugging Walkthrough

## Issues Resolved
### 1. Library Crash (`logging` error)
**Root Cause:** The `meshtastic` library (v2.7.5) crashed when receiving an integer port number instead of a stream for `debugOut`.
**Fix:** Explicitly passed `portNumber=4404` as a keyword argument in [tcp-mqtt-proxy.py](file:///C:/Users/dremb/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cd00e979-2d9a-4abd-80d8-38d6d36e6d90/tcp-mqtt-proxy.py).

### 2. Message Loss / Instability (Protobuf Mismatch)
**Root Cause:** Incompatibility between the library and Node Firmware caused `DecodeError` exceptions. This prevented the proxy from learning channel names from the node.
**Fix:**
- **Crash Protection:** Updated proxy to catch and suppress `DecodeError` instead of crashing.
- **Resilience:** Implemented a fallback to use `Chan_<Index>` for topic names if name lookup fails.
- **Manual Mapping:** Added `CHANNEL_MAP` environment variable to [docker-compose.yml](file:///C:/Users/dremb/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cd00e979-2d9a-4abd-80d8-38d6d36e6d90/docker-compose.yml).

## Final Configuration
Your [docker-compose.yml](file:///C:/Users/dremb/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cd00e979-2d9a-4abd-80d8-38d6d36e6d90/docker-compose.yml) now includes the correct map retrieved from the node:
```yaml
    environment:
      # Found on Node via investigation
      - CHANNEL_MAP=0:LongFast,1:NCMesh,2:NCBotmesh,3:LN4CY_01,37:MCRG256
```

## Verification Results
- **Solo Operation Confirmed:** With the iOS proxy disabled, the Docker proxy is handling 100% of the traffic.
- **Correct Mapping:** I verified specific packets on the `NCMesh` channel (Index 1) are being published to `msh/US/2/e/NCMesh/...` correctly.
- **Stability:** The proxy is running without crashes and handling protocol errors gracefully.
